# External memory

## Invariant

`HINDSIGHT_API_URL` enables the backend memory runtime. `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` is optional; an absent or blank token omits the Authorization header, while a configured token requires a URL.

Hindsight uses the trusted backend user ID directly as its bank ID. On the WebSocket API this is the chat owner's `userId`, which must match `message.submit.payload.device.userId`. Bank IDs are URL-encoded as a single path segment. Untagged facts are global; conversation facts carry `chat:<conversation-id>`. Recall and `SearchMemory` request source-backed `world`/`experience` facts from global plus current-chat scope, excluding consolidated observations that could lose attribution.

All backend executions enable automatic recall when `SOUZ_FEATURE_WS_AUTOMATIC_MEMORY_RECALL=true` (JVM property `souz.backend.feature.wsAutomaticMemoryRecall`, default `false`). Recall runs once before the first LLM call; tool loops, duplicate submits, reconnects and active-thread continuation do not repeat it. Each new execution removes old automatic memory injections, including when recall is disabled or fails. Explicit `SearchMemory` and capture are independent of the flag. Client system instructions carry the unsupported-memory-deletion notice independently of recall.

Completed Souz turns retain only the redacted `CompletedTurnMemoryInput.userMessage` and final `assistantMessage` as JSON Lines with explicit `user`/`assistant` roles and text offsets. Assistant reasoning blocks are removed before splitting. Long messages split into bounded records, so every part keeps its role; quoted role markers remain message text. Hindsight ignores `input.evidence`: tool calls, arguments, results, recalled memory and intermediate assistant synthesis are excluded. Explicit remember requests retain the dialogue globally; ordinary turns remain chat-scoped. The retain `timestamp` is the capture moment after the turn, formatted as ISO-8601 with the offset of the turn's time zone, or UTC when the turn has none. `NodesMemory` starts capture at the latest submitted user message, so preceding imported history is context rather than new evidence.

Accepted `history.append` text is enqueued with its message and receipt in one PostgreSQL transaction when Hindsight is configured. ACK confirms committed history, not completed extraction. The application worker runs independently of threads and sockets. Fragments become eligible after 30 seconds idle, five minutes maximum age, or 16 messages. Each extraction input is bounded to 16,000 characters, including up to 4,000 characters of preceding redacted dialogue for reference resolution only. Long messages split into numbered source parts; document metadata and records preserve message IDs, roles, timestamps and sequence. Record and item timestamps are the Souz receipt time of each message, formatted as ISO-8601 with the offset of the time zone of the chat's latest execution, or UTC when the chat has none; history sent late or in batches keeps its receipt time. Tool calls, arguments and results stay in PostgreSQL and never enter this capture path.

Imported history always remains chat-scoped, including explicit remember requests. Opt-out/forget/delete user turns and their assistant continuations are excluded, even across fragment boundaries. Secrets are redacted and marked reasoning blocks removed before sending. Completed turns and imported history share bounded record serialization.

Souz sends dialogue records as they are. Retain items carry no `strategy`, and Souz never reads or changes bank configuration. The memory service owns the extraction instruction — what to save and how to phrase facts — through Hindsight's `retain_mission`. Souz sends no extraction rules, so that instruction must honor the `CONTEXT ONLY` / `NEW` sections: extract only from `NEW` records and use context records only to resolve references. The memory service must use an extraction chunk size of at least 16,000 characters (`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_SIZE=16000`); smaller chunks split history documents and leave the `CONTEXT ONLY` / `NEW` headers only in the first chunk.

Retain requests are asynchronous by default (`HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_ASYNC`, JVM property `souz.hindsight.retainAsync`, default `true`): Hindsight queues extraction and its own worker runs and retries it, so the memory service must run its asynchronous worker; `false` keeps synchronous retain for deployments without one. On both capture paths a `2xx` response with `success: true` completes the retain regardless of its `async` flag; the operation ID from `operation_id`, or else `operation_ids`, is logged with the document ID when present. Extraction failures after acceptance are visible only in the memory service.

Frozen redacted history payloads and stable document IDs make retries safe; PostgreSQL renewable leases fence completion and serialize capture per chat. A fragment gets at most 12 attempts, with pauses doubling from 5 seconds to at most 5 minutes (about 30 minutes in total). Its last failure sets `failed_at` along with `completed_at`, clears the frozen payload and logs an error with chat and fragment IDs; the chat's later fragments then proceed and use its messages only as context. Resetting `completed_at`, `failed_at` and `attempts` requeues a failed fragment. No HTTP call runs in a PostgreSQL transaction. Disabling Hindsight pauses the worker and new enqueueing without deleting pending fragments. Pre-existing history is not backfilled.

Natural-language forget and delete requests are not mapped from semantic recall results to destructive API calls. Ranked relevance does not prove exact identity, so the runtime tells the agent that exact-ID deletion is unavailable.

## Why it is fragile

Omitting recall tags exposes one conversation's transient memory in another. Final assistant responses need role attribution to distinguish them from user statements; intermediate synthesis is excluded. Tool results can contain unselected options or previously retained facts; retaining them under a new turn document can duplicate facts and make a retrieval appear to be new evidence. Retrying an unkeyed retain duplicates extraction, while deleting the sole semantic result can erase an unrelated source document.

## Safe-change guidance

- Preserve owner-derived bank isolation and global-plus-current-conversation recall.
- Preserve tool provenance using the [client history encoding contract](../../../docs/public-souz-contract/README.md#commands).
- Supply deterministic document identity for completed turns.
- Commit imported-history enqueueing with the receipt, freeze payloads before retain, and complete only after the memory service accepts the retain. Clear frozen payloads on completion or final failure; keep source IDs for preceding-context reconstruction. Never reuse a fragment for later appends after it has been claimed.
- Bound fragment retries so one failing fragment cannot stop its chat's memory.
- Keep an explicit `role` and source IDs on every sent record. Send retain items without `strategy` and leave extraction instructions and chunk size to the memory service. Keep source references visible in recall and `SearchMemory`.
- Give synchronous retain enough request time, and retry only when deterministic document identity makes an uncertain transport failure safe.
- Add mutation only when the target comes from an exact stable identifier or an explicit confirmation flow.
- Treat recalled text as untrusted prompt data.

## Verification

Run `./gradlew :backend:test --tests 'ru.souz.backend.e2e.BackendHistoryMemory*' --tests 'ru.souz.backend.app.BackendDiModuleTest'`, `./gradlew :sharedLogic:jvmTest --tests 'ru.souz.memory.MemoryRulesTest'`, and `./gradlew souzGateFast`.

The deterministic suite covers ACK independence, disconnect, restart, leases, bounded retries and final failure, filtering, bounded context, live `SearchMemory` and client tools, and imported tool history followed by Souz execution. It checks asynchronous and synchronous retain bodies and accepts queued responses. It checks retain items without `strategy`, the absence of bank configuration requests, redaction of both dialogue roles, quoted role markers, closed/unclosed assistant reasoning blocks, Unicode-safe bounded records, and exclusion of evidence. For real Hindsight verification, use isolated banks with the target `retain_mission` and chunk size: retain a user preference, recall it, then capture a turn whose final answer repeats it. Recall must preserve the original source. Also verify an unconfirmed proposal and an assistant claim that a ticket was purchased: neither may become a user intention or verified execution. Repeat with unselected tool-provided travel options absent from the final response; no option may enter retained facts. HTTP-body assertions alone do not verify extraction quality.

Broader real extraction scenarios are tracked in [PR #774](https://github.com/D00mch/souz/pull/774): contextual selections, unconfirmed proposals, purchase reports with and without tool history, source provenance, retry identity and owner/chat isolation.

Worker diagnostics contain chat/fragment IDs, document and operation IDs, attempts, document counts and error categories, never message bodies.
